# WPA3

> * Use the latest security methods
> * Disallow outdated legacy protocols
> * Require use of [Protected Management Frames (PMF)](https://www.wi-fi.org/knowledge-center/faq/what-are-protected-management-frames)
>
> Since Wi-Fi networks differ in usage purpose and security needs, WPA3 includes additional capabilities specifically for personal and enterprise networks. Users of **WPA3-Personal** receive increased protections from password guessing attempts, while **WPA3-Enterprise** users can now take advantage of higher grade security protocols for sensitive data networks. \[[^3]\]
