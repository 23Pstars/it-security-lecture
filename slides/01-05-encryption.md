# WPA3

> * Use the latest security methods
> * Disallow outdated legacy protocols
> * Require use of [Protected Management Frames (PMF)](https://www.wi-fi.org/knowledge-center/faq/what-are-protected-management-frames)
>
> Since Wi-Fi networks differ in usage purpose and security needs, WPA3 includes additional capabilities specifically for personal and enterprise networks. Users of **WPA3-Personal** receive increased protections from password guessing attempts, while **WPA3-Enterprise** users can now take advantage of higher grade security protocols for sensitive data networks. \[[^3]\]

# [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)

> VeraCrypt is a free open source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Brought to you by [IDRIX](https://www.idrix.fr) and based on [TrueCrypt 7.1a](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/).
>
> <small>VeraCrypt is a software for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted right before it is saved and decrypted right after it is loaded, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. Entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, contents of every file, free space, meta data, etc).</small>

## Main Features

* <small>Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk</small>
* <small>Encrypts an entire partition or storage device (e.g. USB flash or hard drive)</small>
* <small>Encrypts a Windows drive or partition (pre-boot authentication)</small>
* <small>Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent</small>
* <small>Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted</small>
* <small>Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors</small>
* <small>Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password</small>
