# Secure Development Lifecycle

:x: Identifying errors in late lifecycle phases makes them more expensive to fix or mitigate. \[[^1]\]

:x: Having an unpublished or informal Secure Development Lifecycle will not be successful. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: Security must be embedded into all stages of the Software Development Lifecycle to be effective. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: A close connection with the right expert and management drive from the beginning are both mandatory. \[[^3]\]

# Spaghetti Analogy

Sprinkling security on insecurely written software is equivalent to sprinkling salt on spaghetti :spaghetti: after cooking them in unsalted water :potable_water:.

# Security Requirements

---

#### [Derive Security Requirements from Business Functionality](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Gather and review functional requirements
* For each functional requirement derive relevant security requirements
  * Lead stakeholders through explicitly noting security expectations
    * e.g. data security, access control, transaction integrity, criticality of business function, separation of duties, uptime etc.
  * Follow the same principles for writing good requirements in general
    * i.e. they should be specific, measurable, and reasonable

---

#### [Security and Compliance Guidance for Requirements](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Determine industry best-practices that project teams should treat as requirements
  * e.g. publicly available guidelines, internal or external guidelines/standards/policies, or established compliance requirements
* Do not attempt to bring in too many best-practice requirements into each development iteration
* Slowly add best-practices over successive development cycles

---

#### Protection Requirements ("Schutzbedarf" :de:) Calculator

* Provides an idea of the expected effort for security topics
* Serves as a starting point for detailed requirements analysis
* Formalizes the "gut-feeling" of business and IT stakeholders

# [Secure Design Principles](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles)

|                               |                               |

| Principle of Defense in Depth | Keep Security simple          |
| Fail securely                 | Fix Security Issues correctly |

---

## Minimize Attack Surface Area

* **Every feature** that is added to an application **adds a certain amount of risk** to the overall application
* The aim for secure development is to **reduce** the overall risk by reducing **the attack surface area**

---

## Establish Secure Defaults

* The **"out-of-box"** experience for the user **should be secure**
* It should be up to the user to reduce their security â€“ if they are allowed

---

## Principle of Least Privilege

* Accounts have the **least amount of privilege required** to perform their business processes
* This encompasses user rights and resource permissions, e.g.
  * CPU limits
  * memory
  * network
  * file system

---

## Principle of Defense in Depth

* Where one control would be reasonable, **more controls that approach risks in different fashions** are better
* In-depth-controls can make severe vulnerabilities extraordinarily difficult to exploit

---

## Fail securely

* Whenever a transaction fails or code execution throws an exception it should **always "fail closed"** and never "fail open"

---

## Don't trust Services

* Third party partners more than likely have differing security policies and posture
* Implicit **trust of externally run systems is not warranted**
* All external systems should be treated in a similar fashion

---

## Separation of Duties

* Separation of duties is a key **fraud control**
* **Administrators should not also be users** of an application they are responsible for

---

## Avoid Security by Obscurity

* Security through obscurity is a weak security control, and nearly always fails when it is the only control
* The **security** of key systems **should not be reliant upon keeping details hidden**

---

## Keep Security simple

* **Attack surface and simp![LastPass-Logo-Color.png](images/02-04-authentication_flaws/LastPass-Logo-Color.png)licity go hand in hand**
* Prefer straightforward and simple code over complex and over-engineered approaches
* Avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a simpler approach would be faster and simpler

---

## Fix Security Issues correctly

* Once a security issue has been identified, it is important to develop a test for it, and to **understand the root cause** of the issue
* It is likely that the security issue is widespread amongst all code bases, so **developing the right fix without introducing regressions** is essential

# Security Logging & Monitoring

---

# Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

* Exploitation of **insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident**
* **Attackers** rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to **achieve their goals without being detected**
  * Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing
  * Allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of successful exploit to nearly 100%

---

# Examples of Insufficiencies

* Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not logged
* Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages
* Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity
* Logs are only stored locally
* Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective
* Penetration testing and scans by automated tools do not trigger alerts
* The application is unable to detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real time or near real time

---

# Prevention

* Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation **failures can be**
  * **logged with sufficient user context** to identify suspicious or malicious accounts
  * **held for sufficient time** to allow delayed forensic analysis
* Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by a **centralized log management solution**
  * e.g. [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash & Beats)

---

* Ensure **high-value transactions have an audit trail** with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion
  * e.g. append-only database tables or similar
* Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that **suspicious activities are detected** and responded to **in a timely fashion**
* Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan
