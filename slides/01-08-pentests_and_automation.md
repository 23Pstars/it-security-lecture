## [Red Team](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/)

> **Red Teams** are external entities brought in to test the effectiveness of a security program. This is accomplished by emulating the behaviors and techniques of likely attackers in the most realistic way possible. The practice is similar, but not identical to, penetration testing, and involves the pursuit of one or more objectives.

---

## [Blue Team](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/)

> **Blue Teams** refer to the internal security team that defends against both real attackers and Red Teams. Blue Teams should be distinguished from standard security teams in most organizations, as most security operations teams do not have a mentality of constant vigilance against attack, which is the mission and perspective of a true Blue Team.
