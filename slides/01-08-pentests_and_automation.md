# Penetration Tests & Security Automation

# Penetration Testing

> A penetration test, or “pen test,” is an attempt to evaluate the security of IT infrastructures using a controlled environment to safely attack, identify, and exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may exist in operating systems, services, networks, and application. They may also exist due to improper configurations or risky end-user behavior.
>
>  Penetration testing assessments are also useful in validating the efficacy of defensive mechanisms and determining how well end-users adhere to security policies. \[[^1]\]

# [Web Security Policies <small>(aka `security.txt`)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-04)</small>

> When security risks are discovered by independent security researchers, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported.  This document defines a standard ("security.txt") to help organizations describe the process for security researchers to follow in order to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.

## [Fields of `security.txt`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-04#section-3.4)

* **Contact**: An address that researchers should use for reporting security issues
* **Encryption**: Encryption key that security researchers should use for encrypted communication
* **Acknowledgements**: Link to a page where security researchers are recognized for their reports
* **Permission**: Value `none` indicates to security researchers that they must not perform any kind of testing. Must not be interpreted as having any legal value.

---

* **Policy**: Link to where your security policy and/or disclosure policy is located
* **Signature**: Full URI of an external signature file that can be used to check the authenticity of a `security.txt` file
* **Hiring**: Linking to the vendor's security-related job positions

Example: <https://securitytxt.org/.well-known/security.txt>

## [Red Team](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/)

> **Red Teams** are external entities brought in to test the effectiveness of a security program. This is accomplished by emulating the behaviors and techniques of likely attackers in the most realistic way possible. The practice is similar, but not identical to, penetration testing, and involves the pursuit of one or more objectives.

---

## [Blue Team](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/)

> **Blue Teams** refer to the internal security team that defends against both real attackers and Red Teams. Blue Teams should be distinguished from standard security teams in most organizations, as most security operations teams do not have a mentality of constant vigilance against attack, which is the mission and perspective of a true Blue Team.
