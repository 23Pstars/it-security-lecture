# Webinar Rules

* Please use the **Q&A** function (if available) for questions related
  to the content
* If you need assistance please contact the moderator(s) via the
  **Chat** function or virtually raise your hand (:hand:) if you would
  like to say/ask something in person
* Survey/quiz/voting exercises (:ballot_box:) might happen within or
  outside the video conferening platform
* Gaps in the exercise numbering are a side-effect of reusing content
  from a larger lecture deck and nothing to worry about
