# [Case Study: CCleaner](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1118367-piriform-ccleaner-compromised-by-multi-stage-backdoor) (2018)

> It has been reported that a version of Piriform CCleaner.exe has been compromised/trojanized resulting in the installation of multi-stage backdoor capable of receiving instructions from threat actors on affected systems. Listed below are the affected versions of CCleaner:
> 
> * CCleaner version 5.33.6162
> * CCleaner Cloud version 1.07.3191

---

# Trojanized CCleaner Distribution

> The distribution of the compromised CCleaner came from the actual website of Piriform. Threat actors were able to compromise the CCleaner binary hosted in the website which resulted to the distribution of the malicious software to unsuspecting users. Since it came from a legitimate source and digitally signed, it would be almost impossible for users to identify that the software has been modified to perform malicious activity.

# [Six Worst Types of Human Malware](https://techtalk.gfi.com/who-is-your-malware/)

1. I am above your puny rules
2. Trust everyone
3. I’ll click anything once
4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
5. I feel the need, the need for speed
6. Patches? We don’t need no stinkin’ patches!

---

## I am above your puny rules

> Yes, we have a policy that prohibits accessing personal email from corporate machines. We even have a proxy in place to block access to all known (by URL) personal webmail services. But try telling the CEO no, just once. Go ahead. Try. If users, any users, can exempt themselves from policy, and don’t take extra cares when they do, they will be a way malware finds in to your systems.

---

## Trust everyone

> You have to love these people for their undeniable faith in humanity and trust for all. You have to try not to kill these people for believing everything, from the banker in Elbonia trying to move money out of the country, to the Prince who has been wrongly deposed. Then there is the helpdesk person who needs their password to restore their data that was lost to a server crash and the relative stuck in a foreign land who cannot call, but can email, asking for funds to help get them home. You almost need to assign them a babysitter so they don’t get phished or fooled again and again and again.

---

## I’ll click anything once

> These are the same people who you probably convinced to lick a flagpole on a freezing day, or to try hamster treats because they taste so good. If they see it online, it must be true, so they will click _anything_ to get that free download, or that prerelease copy of the movie, or to see those pictures that can’t be believed. How many times have you had to reimage their machine because something they clicked was just so, so bad?

---

## Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

> Fool me daily, and it’s just something to laugh about. Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott taught me that Scottish saying, all but the third part. These are the folks who do the same thing, time and again, no matter how many times it has bitten them. Maybe they got tired of waiting for the machine to shut down, so they hit the power switch. Or maybe they keep trying to download cool screensavers, no matter how many times it has turned out to be a virus that trashes their machine. Or maybe they keep giving out their creds to every social engineering attack because the attacker said “please.” No matter what, they just can’t seem to learn.

---

## I feel the need, the need for speed

> “And your crappy antivirus program is making my machine run too slow, so I disabled it. But don’t ask me how a virus got in, because I certainly didn’t download it! Maybe your firewall is not good enough!” In my not so humble opinion, disabling antivirus should be a capital offense!

---

## Patches? We don’t need no stinkin’ patches!

> The worst offender is the one who consciously chooses not to apply a patch. Maybe they are too busy, or don’t have time to test, or just don’t think they need to patch. Patching is one of the best ways to close vulnerabilities that worms and other malware exploit. Leaving a system unpatched is tempting fate, even more so than leaving your sunroof open on a cloudy day.
