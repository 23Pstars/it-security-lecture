# System Requirements

To perform the exercises on your private computer you need

* _either_ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (8.x or 9.x)
* _or_ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* _or_ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

_:information_source: On the university computers Node.js should already be available through `nvm`. You can verify this by running `node -v` on the command line. It should display an 8.x (or 9.x) version. If it shows any older or newer version please run `nvm install 8.11.3` and then `nvm use 8.11.3` to install and switch to that version._
